# Duet Angular Example

An example app built with [@duetds/angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@duetds/angular), demonstrating basic form handling.

## Features

- Comes with [Duet Web Components](https://www.duetds.com/components/).
- Supports [Duet Design Tokens](https://www.duetds.com/tokens/) in SCSS without additional configuration.
- Comes with automated build and deploy steps for prototyping.
- Additionally comes with [Duet Fonts](https://www.duetds.com/typography/) and [Duet CSS Framework](https://www.duetds.com/css-framework/) preconfigured.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
